    """Extract size/mime/dimension/duration metadata from a Telegram media object.

    THE single extractor for these five columns: both the scheduled sweep
    (``TelegramBackup._process_media``) and the realtime listener call it, so a
    sweep that re-upserts a message the listener already stored writes back the
    SAME values instead of nulling them (#263). Two divergent copies of this logic
    are what produced the bug: live-captured voice notes rendered without their
    duration while the same note captured by the sweep showed it.

    THE RETURNED KEY SET IS A CONTRACT: exactly ``file_size``, ``mime_type``,
    ``width``, ``height``, ``duration`` — every key always present, value ``None``
    when unknown. Both callers spread it into a ``media`` row and then OVERRIDE
    ``file_size`` with the on-disk byte count (the sweep re-assigns it after the
    spread, the listener mutates the dict before spreading); the other four are
    taken as returned. Adding or renaming a key here silently changes what those
    rows write, so ``TestExtractMediaAttributes`` pins the key set — extend both
    callers and that test together. ``file_size`` is Telegram's DECLARED size and
    is the value that survives only when no file was written.

    ``mime_type`` is read off ``media.document`` (the ``MessageMediaDocument``
    wrapper itself has no ``mime_type``; the sweep's old ``getattr(media, ...)``
    read therefore always yielded ``None``). Photo dimensions and ``file_size``
    come from the largest ``PhotoSize`` (the ``Photo`` object itself carries no
    ``w``/``h``), sized via ``_photo_size_bytes`` so progressive renditions count.

    ``duration`` is coerced to ``int``: Telethon reports video durations as a
    float while the ``media.duration`` column is INTEGER. Rounding (not
    truncation) is used because that is what PostgreSQL's implicit float->int
    assignment cast did to the raw floats the sweep has always passed, so newly

    ``Media.file_path``, not the original document name. The viewer already hides
    the prefix (``getMediaDisplayName`` in index.html); this is the server-side
    twin so a forced download saves ``holiday.jpg`` rather than the storage name.

    Takes only the basename, because the only caller (``serve_media``) only has a

    explicit ``import_<chat>_<msg>_`` alternation: the viewer strips that prefix
