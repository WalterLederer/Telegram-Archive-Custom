    Despite the name (kept for backwards compatibility - it predates its
    second use), this is a generic, client-wide flood absorption window: any
    caller whose retry-from-scratch would otherwise be wasteful under
    flood_sleep_threshold=0 can use it. Used by media downloads (#232,
    MEDIA_FLOOD_SLEEP_THRESHOLD) and by ``_get_dialogs()`` (#295,
    DIALOG_FLOOD_SLEEP_THRESHOLD).

    With the app-wide ``flood_sleep_threshold=0`` (#124) a FloodWait aborts
    the wrapped call entirely and the outer retry restarts from scratch - for
    media downloads that means byte 0 (#232); for get_dialogs() it means
    re-walking every already-successful page before re-tripping the same
    later page (#295). Inside this context Telethon absorbs floods up to
    ``threshold`` seconds: it sleeps and re-issues the SAME request, so a
    media transfer resumes at its current offset and get_dialogs() resumes
    its current page (Telethon logs each absorbed sleep at INFO on its own
    logger). Floods above the threshold still raise and follow the normal
    ``call_with_flood_retry`` path.

    The threshold is a client-wide attribute and the client is shared with the
    real-time listener, so a request that floods on another task while a media
    transfer holds this context is absorbed too — a deliberate, bounded
    dilution of #124's per-call visibility (Telethon's ``__call__`` drops its
    per-request threshold kwarg, so the client attribute is the only lever).
    Ref-counted so overlapping transfers (sweep + listener) restore correctly;
    the counter updates have no awaits between read and write, so the single-
    threaded event loop keeps them atomic. When contexts overlap, the FIRST
    (outermost) threshold stays in effect — a nested different value is
    deliberately ignored. No-ops for a non-positive or non-int threshold

    """Wrap ``client.iter_messages`` so FloodWaitError is logged and retried.

    With ``flood_sleep_threshold=0`` on the client, every flood-wait bubbles up
    as an exception (media downloads are the one scoped exception: they raise
    the threshold via ``absorb_media_floods`` for the transfer window — #232).
    We log the wait and resume iteration from the last yielded message id so
    progress isn't lost.

    Bounded retries: the inner ``while`` is capped at ``MAX_FLOOD_RETRIES``
    *consecutive* flood-waits without progress, and the counter resets every
    time iteration yields a message. Without the cap, an account-restricted
    Telegram session would loop forever on one chat and block every later one.

    Bounded sleep: waits above ``MAX_FLOOD_WAIT_SECONDS`` abort the current
    operation instead of retrying before Telegram's required wait has elapsed.

    The ``FLOOD_WAIT_LOG_THRESHOLD`` env var (default 10) suppresses log
    output for short waits — those are routine and noisy in healthy backfills.
    Set to 0 to log every wait.

    Dropped connections are handled the same way (#265). A long backfill easily
    outlives Telethon's internal reconnect budget (5 attempts, then it marks the
    sender disconnected and stops retrying by itself), after which every request
    raises ``ConnectionError("Cannot send requests while disconnected")``. That
    used to abort the whole chat on the first such error, and — because nothing
    ever called ``connect()`` again — every later chat in the sweep died the same
    way. Now the connection is re-established and iteration resumes from the last
    yielded id, sharing the same bounded retry budget. Errors Telegram raises for
    a permanent condition (``RPCError`` and friends) still propagate untouched.

    Note: resume tracking uses ``max(resume_from, msg.id)`` which is only
    correct for ascending iteration (``reverse=True``).
