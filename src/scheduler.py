"""
Scheduler for automated Telegram backups.
Runs backup tasks on a configurable cron schedule.

Optionally runs a real-time listener that catches message edits and deletions
between scheduled backup runs (when ENABLE_LISTENER=true).

SHARED CONNECTION ARCHITECTURE:
Each configured account has a single TelegramClient shared between its backup
and listener components. This avoids session file lock conflicts and allows
both to run simultaneously. Accounts are swept SEQUENTIALLY: account 1's full
backup completes before account 2's starts — Telegram tolerates N sessions,
not N concurrent full sweeps from one box.
