"""Widen idx_messages_topic with date so the topic sidebar stops touching the heap.

GET /api/chats/{chat_id}/topics aggregates count and max(date) per topic over
every message row of the chat. Grouped on coalesce(reply_to_top_id, 1) the
planner needed a temp b-tree and a heap lookup per row (raw_data included);
grouped on the raw column with this index carrying account_id and date, the
whole aggregate is a covering index scan on the account-scoped path the
viewer always takes: measured 19.0 ms -> 1.3 ms at 60k rows on SQLite
(unscoped legacy calls keep a covering scan with a temp b-tree), with the
NULL bucket folded into the General topic in Python instead of SQL.

The index keeps its name across the widening, so idempotency is keyed on the
COLUMN LIST, not existence: a create_all() database already has the 4-column
shape from the model declaration, an upgraded database has the 2-column one.
Guarded both directions — the entrypoint stamping ladder tops out at 018 and
relies on every later migration being idempotent.
