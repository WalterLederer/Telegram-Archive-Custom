"""Fix stale positive-ID folder prefixes in media.file_path.

Before v4.0.5, the backup stored media in directories named with raw (positive)
entity IDs. After v4.0.5, directories use Telethon's marked IDs (negative for
groups/channels). The v4.0.6 migration fixed chat_id columns but never updated
file_path strings, leaving ~37% of media rows with paths pointing to the wrong
folder name.

This migration rewrites file_path values so the folder component matches the
marked chat_id already stored in media.chat_id.
