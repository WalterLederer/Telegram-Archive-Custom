"""Make ``alembic upgrade head`` produce exactly the schema in models.py.

Until now this project had two schema authors that nothing compared:
``Base.metadata.create_all`` (SQLite only, from ``src/db/base.py``) and this
migration chain (the only author PostgreSQL ever had). They had drifted to 54
structural differences on SQLite and 50 on PostgreSQL. This migration removes
every one of them, and ``tests/test_schema_parity.py`` keeps them removed: its
allow-list is empty, so any new divergence between the two authors fails CI on
both backends.

What it changes, and why each is safe:

* **NOT NULL on 35 columns.** The ORM has always marked them non-optional; the
  migrations never said so, so a PostgreSQL install accepted NULLs that the
  SQLite install of the same version rejected. Every column is backfilled with
  the ORM's own default *before* it is tightened, so a database holding NULLs
  converges instead of crash-looping on ``SET NOT NULL``. The one fill that is
  not the ORM default is ``viewer_tokens.is_revoked``, filled with ``1``: the
  token validator only reads rows with ``is_revoked = 0``, so a NULL there was
  an unusable token, and a token in an unknown state must stay unusable. It is
  alone in that. The only other backfilled gate, ``no_download``, is read for
  Python truthiness, where NULL and ``0`` are the same answer; the remaining
  fills are timestamps, cursors and display flags whose worst case is redoing
  idempotent work (a zeroed ``media.downloaded`` becomes a download candidate
  again).
* **Server defaults.** ``created_at``/``updated_at`` gain the ``func.now()``
  default the ORM declares. ``messages.is_pinned``/``is_outgoing`` and
  ``media.downloaded`` lose the literal ``0`` the ORM does not declare (their
  value is always supplied Python-side). ``chats.id``/``users.id`` lose the
  ``BIGSERIAL`` sequence migration 001 gave them by accident — those ids come
  from Telegram and were never generated.
* **``media.file_path`` VARCHAR(500) -> TEXT on PostgreSQL.** This one is a live
  bug: models.py widened it to Text in v6.0.0 for long paths, no migration
  followed, so a path over 500 characters raises StringDataRightTruncation on
  PostgreSQL and inserts fine on SQLite.
* **INTEGER -> BIGINT on eight SQLite columns** that migration 005's
  hand-written rebuild declared narrower than the ORM. Cosmetic on SQLite
  (both are 8-byte), but it is the same declaration that produced the
  VARCHAR(500) above, and leaving it makes the gate impossible to satisfy.
* **``fk_reaction_message``.** The ORM constrains a reaction to its message; no
  migration ever created it, so an Alembic-built install has orphanable
  reaction rows. Orphans are deleted first or the constraint cannot be added.
* **``_messages_media_backup``.** Migration 005 creates this rollback table and
  drops it only in its downgrade, so every Alembic-built install carries a copy
  forever. It is dropped ONLY when empty: on a database that really did upgrade
  through v6.0.0 with legacy media rows it still holds the pre-normalization
  pointers, and this migration will not delete those.
* **``idx_audit_log_username`` / ``idx_audit_log_created``.** Migration 007
  creates them, but a 7.x SQLite install provisioned by ``create_all`` was
  stamped past 007 before models.py declared these indexes, so its
  ``viewer_audit_log`` was born unindexed and nothing later in the chain or in
  the app would ever index it — the admin audit page full-scans a table that
  grows with every login. Created here when absent, on both backends.

Idempotency: every step reads the live schema first and does nothing when the
object is already in its target shape, so this runs clean against a database
provisioned by ``create_all`` (where most of it is already true), against one
built by this chain, and against a re-run of itself.

Two leftovers are deliberate. A SQLite database created by the ``create_all``
of a release before this one carries the reactions -> users foreign key
unnamed, because models.py only started naming it ``fk_reactions_user`` here.
SQLite never enforces that constraint (nothing in this project sets ``PRAGMA
foreign_keys=ON``) and never exposes its name, so relabelling it would mean
rebuilding a table of the user's data for a label nothing can observe. Every
freshly built schema on either backend agrees, which is what the parity gate
checks. The same ``create_all`` databases may also keep reaction rows whose
message is gone: the orphan delete runs only where ``fk_reaction_message`` has
to be added, because there it is the difference between the ADD succeeding and
failing. Where the constraint already exists it has sat unenforced since
``create_all`` built it, and rows of the user's data are not deleted for a
constraint nothing checks.
