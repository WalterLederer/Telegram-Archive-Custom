"""Add a pg_trgm GIN index on messages.text for the viewer's search (PostgreSQL).

get_messages_paginated / get_all_chats' search filters both use
``Message.text.ILIKE('%term%')`` (leading wildcard - substring search, not a
prefix match). A plain B-tree index can't serve that pattern at all, so every
search was a sequential scan of the whole messages table, with cost growing
linearly as the archive grows. Verified on a live ~100k-row instance:

    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT id FROM messages WHERE text ILIKE '%test%' LIMIT 20;

    Before: Seq Scan on messages (actual time=4.556..36.063, Rows Removed by
            Filter: 6080) - Execution Time: 41.764 ms
    After:  Bitmap Heap Scan on messages using idx_messages_text_trgm
            (actual time=0.147..0.368) - Execution Time: 0.438 ms

~95x faster on this dataset, and critically the scan cost moves from O(table
size) to roughly O(matching rows) - a sequential scan degrades linearly as
more messages are backed up, while the trigram index does not.

The index is created on every dialect (same name/column, so ORM- and
Alembic-built schemas agree per tests/test_schema_parity.py), but only
PostgreSQL gets the GIN/pg_trgm treatment that actually makes it useful.
SQLite has no pg_trgm equivalent, so it gets a plain B-tree there instead -
harmless, if unused for this particular query pattern, and matches what
``postgresql_using``/``postgresql_ops`` (dialect-scoped kwargs on the
models.py Index()) already produce via ``Base.metadata.create_all()``:
SQLAlchemy silently drops PostgreSQL-only kwargs on every other dialect
rather than erroring.

No CONCURRENTLY: this project's existing index migrations run inside
Alembic's normal transactional DDL (see #213/017), so this one does too for
consistency. On an already-large `messages` table this will briefly hold a
lock for the duration of the index build - acceptable for the same reason
prior structural changes to this table were: migrations run once, and this
one is asymptotically the same cost class as REINDEXing an existing index.
