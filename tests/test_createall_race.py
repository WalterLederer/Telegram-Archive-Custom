"""The viewer must never build tables into a database Alembic owns.

The hazard
----------
``Dockerfile.viewer`` ships no ``alembic/`` and sets no ENTRYPOINT — it runs
uvicorn directly — so the viewer container can never migrate. It does, however,
reach ``Base.metadata.create_all(checkfirst=True)`` in ``src/db/base.py`` on
every SQLite start, and ``docker-compose.yml`` starts it concurrently with the
backup container, which *is* running ``alembic upgrade head`` on the same file.

Unguarded, ``checkfirst=True`` adds whole missing tables. Land one of those
inside a database a migration is halfway through rebuilding and the migration's
own ``CREATE TABLE`` dies with "table already exists"; the backup container then
crash-loops against what is usually the only copy of someone's Telegram history.

What is asserted
----------------
An existing database gains **nothing**: not a table, not an index, not a
trigger. ``sqlite_master`` is snapshotted before and after a real
``DatabaseManager.init()`` and must come back byte-identical.

Why the fixtures drop tables
----------------------------
A 7.x file is, to a newer viewer, exactly "a database Alembic owns that is
missing tables the current ORM declares". Building that shape by dropping real
tables reproduces it without pinning the test to whichever tables the next
migration happens to add, and — unlike a same-version database, where
``create_all`` is a no-op anyway — it gives the assertion something real to
catch. ``test_removing_the_guard_puts_the_tables_back`` is the positive control:
it defeats the guard and watches those same assertions go red.

Which of these can go red
-------------------------
Deleting the guard line from ``src/db/base.py`` fails
``test_alembic_owned_database_gains_nothing``,
``test_pre_alembic_database_gains_nothing``,
``test_the_viewers_own_startup_path_creates_nothing`` and both
``test_repeated_starts_stay_a_no_op`` cases — measured, 5 failures. The other
three are meant to survive it: the two fresh-database tests assert the fallback
still works, which the guard does not change, and the alembic_version test
guards a second invariant (nothing here ever stamps) that ``create_all`` was
never going to break on its own.
