"""What the v8.0.0 keys buy, proved against real databases on both backends.

Every test here is a collision that a decorative ``account_id`` column would NOT
have prevented. They were built and run against scratch schemas before the
schema was changed, and each one describes silent, permanent loss of a second
account's data — not an error anyone would have seen.

The tests use a real engine on SQLite and on PostgreSQL. They talk to the tables
directly rather than through ``DatabaseAdapter`` on purpose: what is under test
is the shape of the schema, and the adapter's own account plumbing lands in the
change after this one.
