"""#272: the account holder's identity must never reach the logs.

The project already forbids logging chat ids, topic ids and titles, and message
content. Nine call sites wrote the account's own first name, last name,
username, phone number and Telegram user id instead, and survived for months
because the rule was written down (2026-04-18) long after those lines were
(2025-11-25 through 2026-01-18). Nothing checked, so nothing caught it.

This is that check. It is deliberately a scan of whole trees rather than
assertions about the known lines: pinning the known sites would not have
prevented the original drift, because every one of them predated the rule.

It covers ``src`` AND ``scripts``. The first draft scanned only ``src`` and was
green while ``scripts/restore_chat.py`` logged the same name and phone the fix
had just removed — a scanner whose blind spot contains a live violation is worse
than none, because it certifies the gap. ``scripts`` is not incidental: the
documented session-recovery path runs those files under ``docker run``, so their
output lands in the container log stream like everything else.

``print`` counts as a logging call here for the same reason: these scripts print
to stdout, which is captured identically. Anything unrecognised is treated as a
log call rather than waved through — for a guard, the safe default is to ask.

The Telegram user id IS covered, but only on the account. #272 lists it, and
``telegram_backup.py`` did log ``me.id`` — yet banning ``.id`` outright would
also catch ``listener.py``'s failed-download ``message.id``, which is both a
different rule and legitimate debugging detail. So the scan first works out
which locals hold the result of ``get_me()`` and bans ``.id`` on those alone.
The same id is still stored as ``owner_id``, which is storage, not logging.

Chat ids, topic ids and titles are the separate documented rule — "never log
chat IDs, topic IDs, or topic titles" — enforced lower in this file by
``TestNoChatIdentifiersInLogs`` (#274). It was added after the account rule, once
its own backlog of pre-existing violations had been cleared.

One honest limit, shared by both scans: they see an identifier only when a
logging call reads it DIRECTLY — as a banned attribute, a chat/topic-ish
variable name, or a chat/topic object's ``id``/``name``/``title`` field. What
they CANNOT see is a value laundered through another call before logging:
``config.py``'s legitimate ``bool(config.phone)``, or ``migrate_media_paths``'s
``folder = str(chat_id)`` where the chat id becomes a generically-named string.
Telling those apart needs real taint analysis; the ``migrate_media_paths`` folder
logs were found and redacted by review, not by this scan. It catches the shapes
the leaks actually had, not every conceivable one.

Scope limit on the exception rule below: it covers a handler whose OWN try body
calls a filesystem operation. An OSError raised deep inside a nested call and
caught by an outer handler is invisible to it, because that handler's try body
shows no filesystem call. Those outer handlers keep ``exc_info``; catching them
would need whole-program analysis, and stripping every traceback in the codebase
would cost far more debuggability than the speculative risk is worth.

The other blind spot is EXCEPTION TEXT. ``OSError`` stringifies as
``[Errno 66] Directory not empty: '/media/-1001234'`` — the path, and a media
path carries the chat-id folder — so ``logger.error(f"...: {e}")`` on a
filesystem operation re-leaks an id that the surrounding message no longer
names. Those sites log ``type(e).__name__`` instead. The scan cannot see this
either: ``{e}`` is opaque to it. Reviewers found these; when touching a log line
near a chat-derived path, check what the exception itself would print.

Requires Python 3.14: ``ast.parse`` here must read the repo's own sources, which
use PEP 758 unparenthesized ``except A, B:``. On an older interpreter this fails
with a raw SyntaxError rather than a meaningful assertion.
