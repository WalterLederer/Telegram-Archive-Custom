"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The point of this file is ``real_adapter``: a genuine :class:`DatabaseAdapter`
bound to a genuine engine, parameterised over SQLite *and* PostgreSQL.

Why it exists
-------------
Most adapter tests build a ``MagicMock`` DatabaseManager and assert that
``session.execute`` was awaited. That proves the Python branch was taken; it
does not prove the statement compiles, and it certainly does not prove the
database accepts it. Every dialect-specific branch in ``src/db/adapter.py``
(``sqlite_insert`` vs ``pg_insert``, ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` vs the SQLite
no-op-write lock, ``ilike`` escaping) is therefore untested against the backend
it exists for. A test that cannot go red is not a test.

Using it
--------
Request ``real_adapter`` (or ``real_db`` for the manager itself) and the test
runs twice: once on a throwaway SQLite file, once on PostgreSQL. The PostgreSQL
leg skips cleanly when no server is reachable, so a laptop without Docker still
gets a green suite — it just gets half the coverage, and says so.

Pointing it at a server
-----------------------
``TEST_POSTGRES_URL`` (preferred) or ``DATABASE_URL``. Either way the suite
connects to the *server* in that URL but never reads or writes the database
named in it: it creates and uses a dedicated ``telegram_archive_pytest``
database, whose ``public`` schema is dropped and rebuilt once per session.
